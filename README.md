# Yuozas Chess
Here you can check out my rushed chess code built with `C#` on `UnityEngine`

> I didn't try to write this code clean. My goal was to write chess game as fast as I can. Not to make it easier for others to read

---
You can try to run this game in browser with this: 
[WebGL built version](https://im-yuzo.itch.io/chess)

> Even tho you can try it out in the browser, WebGL version might have lots of bugs like:
>
> Not displaying text correctly or not playing background video at the start.
> 
> I'm not going to fix them, that is not the goal of this project.
