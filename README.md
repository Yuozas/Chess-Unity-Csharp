# Chess-Unity-Csharp
Here you can check out my rushed chess code built with C# on UnityEngine 

I didn't try to write this code clean. My goal was to write chess game as fast as I can. Not to make it easier for others to read


You can try to run this game in browser with this: 
[WebGL built version](https://im-yuzo.itch.io/chess)

Even tho you can try it out in the browser, WebGL version might have lots of bugs which I'm not going to fix, that is not my goal.
